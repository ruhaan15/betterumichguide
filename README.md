run server with `npm run dev`

**DONT FORGET TO RUN `git checkout main`, then `git pull` EVERY TIME BEFORE YOU WORK**

Git worklow:
1. Update local main: `git checkout main`
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b <branch name>`
3. Push the empty branch: `git push --set-upstream origin <branch name>`
4. Develop stuff on the branch: (normal git workflow, git add then git push)
5. When branch development is complete, merge the branch into our main: go into github.com and open a pull request on the branch. Set the base repository to ruhaan15/betterumichguide. See screenshot below for example:

the base should be the main branch of our fork

Getting in the habit of using branchs for dev will be good in the long run, and will allow for an organized repo.
