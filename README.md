run server with `npm run dev`

**DONT FORGET TO RUN `git checkout main`, then `git pull` EVERY TIME BEFORE YOU WORK**

Git worklow:
1. Update local main: `git checkout main`
2. Create a new branch (only IF YOU ARE DEVELOPING A NEW BRANCH): `git checkout -b <branch name>`**OR** run `git fetch` and `git checkout <branch name>` if you are developing on an existing branch
3. Push the empty branch: `git push --set-upstream origin <branch name>`
4. Develop stuff on the branch: (normal git workflow, git add then git push)
5. When branch development is complete, merge the branch into our main: go into github.com and open a pull request on the branch. Set the base repository to ruhaan15/betterumichguide

Getting in the habit of using branchs for dev will be good in the long run, and will allow for an organized repo.
